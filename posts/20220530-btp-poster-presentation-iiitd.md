# IIIT-D BTP Poster Presentation 2022

[IIIT-D](#https://www.iiitd.ac.in) provides undergraduate students a unique opportunity to participate in research / engineering / entrepreunership projects. They do so by contributing to projects led by Professors / PhD students. 

At the end of every semester, the students present their work in the form of posters and presentations. On May 13, 2022, I got the golden opporuntiy to present my work and interact with other students also.

Some themes explored by students are :
- AI + healthcare : Building AI models for use in healthcare
- Engineering + healthcare : Building tools in collaboration with heathcare practitioners for use in clinics and hospitals.
- Graph Neural Networks : An emerging field of Deep Learning.
- Social Network Analysis
- Natural Language Processing
- Federated Learning
- Wireless Networks 
- Computer Networks + Algorithms
and many more...

These projects clearly allow students to explore beyond what is taught in courses by allowing them an opportunity to read state-of-the-art research papers, take part in conferences, talk to stakeholders, do market research and much more.

Students are encouraged to make use of this opportunity to explore further. Institutes of Higher Education are encouraged to bring about such activities in their curriculum to allow students to become active learners and explorers.

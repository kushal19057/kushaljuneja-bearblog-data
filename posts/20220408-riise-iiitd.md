# RIISE IIIT-D 2022

On April 8 2022, I attended [RIISE event](https://iiitd.ac.in/riise2022/) organised by IIIT-D. During the event, I interacted with students of IIIT-D and outside presenting their research, engineering and entrepreunership work.

List of poster presentations and talks I attended (non-exhaustive list in no particular order) :
- [Keynote address by Sachin Joshi (IBM)](#ibm-keynote)
- [Project Vimaan](#project-vimaan)
- [Wireless Federated Learning](#federated-learning-metalhead)
- [Building Explainable AI Systems](#explainable-ai-devansh)

## [Talk] Keynote address by Sachin Joshi (IBM) <a name="ibm-keynote"></a>

The talk was about Chat Bots and Conversational AI Systems. The speaker talked about how researchers tackle this problem (using SOTA DL + NLP models) and how industrial tools (like Google DialogFlow) solve it. I found the talk to be insightful, as it talked about concepts such as slot filling, intent classification, natural language understanding, transformers, conversational AI and much more. I also recommend reading the [engineering paper of snips.ai](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10190) and [blogs by slanglabs.in](https://www.slanglabs.in/blog) if you are interested in this domain. Both [snips](https://snips.ai) and [slanglabs](https://www.slanglabs.in) are taking the concept of conversational AI one step ahead by adding the dimension of voice and regional languages. Worth checking out.

## [Engineering] Project Vimaan <a name="project-vimaan"></a>

Project Vimaan is a team of 4 IIITD undergrads aiming to build infrastructure for drones and UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). They are doing so by building battery charging pods and building drones that land autonomously on these pods (using precision landing), replace old-discharged battery with a new-charged battery, and continue flying. 
The presentation saw them showing videos of test flights, showing drones and individual components used, and giving a test flight to show their idea. Pretty cool! Meet the team (from L -> R) Dev Rajput, Aniansh Raj Singh, Harsh, and Bassam Pervez. 
You can also find Aniansh going around the college with drones flying over his head :)

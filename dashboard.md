# Hi I'm Kushal Juneja.
I like tinkering with ideas and making little apps and prototypes. I'm interested in :
- Software Engineering (micro-services, Go, Apache Kafka) 
- Artificial Intelligence (NLP, ML, DL ...)
- Social Network Analysis

I'm currently studying Computer Science at [IIIT-Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), India. I keep a list of previous projects [here](https://kushaljuneja.bearblog.dev/projects/). I also [write](https://kushaljuneja.bearblog.dev/blog/) about my projects, tech, experiences and general topics I'm interested in.
